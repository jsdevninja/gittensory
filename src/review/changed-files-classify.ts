// Deterministic changed-file classifier for the review changed-files summary (#2143, part of #1957). Maps a changed

// deterministically. Pure + path-only — no diff content, no IO — composing the existing hardened path-matchers.
//
// NOTE: this is DISTINCT from `classifyChangedFile` in src/signals/path-matchers.ts, which returns the finer-grained
// 10-way slop category with a DIFFERENT precedence (it ranks config above test). This review classifier deliberately
// uses its own precedence below, so it can't just fold that one.

 * Classify a changed file path into one review bucket. FIXED precedence — `generated > test > docs > config > source`
 * — so a file matching several buckets (a generated test file, a lockfile, a vendored fixture) always resolves to the
 * higher-precedence class deterministically:
 *  - `generated`: machine-produced/imported output (generated markers, vendored trees, lockfiles, minified bundles) —
 *    never real hand-authored effort, so it outranks everything.
 *  - `test`, `docs`, `config`: the remaining recognized categories, in that order.
 *  - `source`: anything unrecognized (including plain code) falls through here.
 * Pure.
