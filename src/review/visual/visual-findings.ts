// Advisory-only AI-vision analysis of before/after visual captures (#4111, part of the visual-capture
// convergence epic #3607). PURE decision + prompt/response logic ONLY — this module never fetches screenshot
// bytes, calls an AI provider, or touches D1; a caller supplies already-resolved images (as
// `AiContentBlock[]`, see `../../types`), a resolved BYOK provider key, and a resolved reputation signal, so
// this file stays testable without network or D1 fixtures. Wiring a live caller — fetch the captured PNG
// bytes, resolve submitter reputation + BYOK, invoke `callAiProvider`/the self-host AI with the images, and
// append the resulting finding to `advisory.findings` — is a deliberately deferred follow-up (see the #4111
// PR description); this module ships the gating + message-shape + parsing + finding-construction it needs.
//
// STRICTLY ADVISORY: `VISUAL_REGRESSION_FINDING_CODE` is not one of the codes `isConfiguredGateBlocker`
// (src/rules/advisory.ts) recognizes, so a visual finding can NEVER become a gate blocker — it rides the
// identical `advisory.findings` pipeline `ai_consensus_defect`/`ai_review_split` already use, recovered in the
// unified comment exactly like a consensus defect (see `review/unified-comment-bridge.ts`'s
// `visualFindingsFromFindings`), but there is no code path that promotes it to `blockers`.
