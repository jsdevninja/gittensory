// Convergence (RAG retrieval) wiring: feeds the AI reviewer the most RELEVANT EXISTING code/docs from the
// repository's CURRENT tree (callers, related modules, existing conventions) that the diff alone doesn't show,
// so a non-frontier model judges the change against how the rest of the codebase actually works. This is the
// RETRIEVAL half of codebase RAG (Layer C) — additive prompt context, exactly like `grounding-wire`.
//
// Single env switch: GITTENSORY_REVIEW_RAG. Default OFF (unset/"false") — when OFF this module is never invoked from
// the review path (the caller guards on the flag), gathers nothing, makes NO adapter use and NO vector query,
// and the reviewer prompt is byte-identical to today. Truthy follows the codebase convention
// (`/^(1|true|yes|on)$/i`, same as isGroundingEnabled / isSafetyEnabled / isEnabled).
//
// The ported, self-contained retrieval engine lives in `./rag` (`retrieveContext`, fully fail-safe); this file
// is the thin HOST adapter that (1) builds the injected infra via `createReviewAdapters(env)` (which degrades a
// missing Vectorize/AI binding to an unavailable adapter), (2) composes the query text from the PR's changed
// files + diff, and (3) returns the retrieved block to splice into the user prompt. Fully fail-safe: a missing
// Vectorize/AI binding, an empty/cold index, or ANY error degrades to "" (no context) and the review proceeds on
// the diff. This module NEVER throws.
//
// DEFERRED — the INDEX-POPULATION job + cron (OUT OF SCOPE for this chunk). Retrieval is inert until an index
// exists: a real Vectorize resource must be provisioned AND a repo's CODE must be ingested (fetch tree → chunk
// via `chunkFile` → embed via `embedTexts` → `upsertChunks` to Vectorize + the `repo_chunks` table), then kept
// fresh on push (incremental re-index via `deleteChunksForPaths` + `upsertChunks`) on a cron. That job is a
// DEPLOY-TIME / ops concern (it needs the live Vectorize binding + the queue + the `repo_chunks` migration) and
// is tracked here as `INDEX_JOB_FOLLOWUP` / the `populateRepoIndexStub` documented stub below. Until it runs,
// `retrieveContext` sees a cold namespace and returns "" — the capability activates once an index exists AND the
// flag is ON (exactly as grounding activates once data is attached).
