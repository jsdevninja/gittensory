// ORB wiring for #7983's same-rule repeat alarm. Records a #7982 rule-fired signal for each gate blocker code
// on every gate block, then checks whether that SAME (repo, blocker code) pair has now fired against enough
// DISTINCT PRs within a short window to be a "something is systematically broken" signal — independent of
// whether any of those blocks has since been confirmed or reversed by a human (unlike the precision-over-time
// circuit breaker in auto-tune.ts, which needs a real, DECIDED sample of >= AUTOTUNE_MIN_DECIDED and however
// long that takes to accumulate). This is exactly the gap the 2026-07-21/22 metagraphed incident exposed: 4
// distinct PRs mis-closed by the same rule within ~3 hours, far faster than any ground-truth-based breaker
// could ever react.
//
// DETECTION + ALERT ONLY (#7983's own stated boundary, mirroring src/orb/analytics.ts's gamingPatternFlags
// precedent: "Detection only — never an automatic action"). This module never holds, closes, or otherwise
// changes any gate/disposition decision — it only records a signal and, once, surfaces a structured alert.
//
// Alert channel: NOT notify-discord.ts/notify-slack (that's a per-REPO, community-facing channel for PR
// action notifications — the wrong audience for "an ORB rule may be systematically broken," which is an
// OPERATOR concern that can span any repo the instance reviews). Uses the same console.error(JSON.stringify(
// {level:"error",...})) idiom src/review/ops-wire.ts's runOpsAlerts already uses for its own operator-anomaly
// detection — forwarded to Sentry by selfhost/sentry.ts's forwardStructuredLogToSentry, the actually-live
// operator-facing channel for exactly this class of "detected an anomaly, not a caught exception" alert.
