// Foreground-liveness invariant (#selfhost-queue-liveness): live contributor-PR-review work (github-webhook,
// agent-regate-pr, agent-regate-sweep, recapture-preview -- everything at or above FOREGROUND_QUEUE_PRIORITY_FLOOR,
// see queue-common.ts) must always have a BOUNDED runnable trickle, mirroring the maintenance lane's own
// maxDeferAgeMs escape hatch (maintenance-admission.ts). Unlike maintenance jobs, foreground jobs never go through
// an admission gate of their own -- only the GitHub rate-limit admission check (processOne, before consume()) and
// the rate-limit BUDGET sweep (deferPendingJobsForRateLimit) can push a foreground job's run_after into the
// future, and NEITHER exempts foreground priority the way maintenance-admission exempts it entirely: a
// GITHUB_BUDGET_BACKGROUND_TYPES job like agent-regate-pr (a literal "contributor PR review", priority 9,
// foreground) is rate-limited with the SAME conservative headroom as genuine maintenance sweeps
// (MAINTENANCE_RESERVED_HEADROOM, see queue-common.ts's githubRateLimitAdmissionTargetForJob), so a shared REST
// budget drained by a post-deploy catch-up burst can defer it for the full rate-limit reset window (up to
// MAX_GITHUB_RATE_LIMIT_RETRY_MS = 65 minutes) with no floor. Without this module, that lane can silently starve
// entirely: hundreds of pending contributor-PR-review jobs, zero processing, zero runnable, requiring manual
// intervention -- the production incident this module exists to make structurally impossible.
//
// The queue backends (pg-queue.ts / sqlite-queue.ts) run releaseStaleForegroundDeferrals() periodically (see
// start()) AND once at boot (init()), so a restart/deploy self-heals inherited over-deferral instead of needing
// manual unsticking. A dedicated slow interval (not the 1s poll tick) bounds retry cost: a job still genuinely
// rate-limited after being released just re-defers and waits for the NEXT sweep, never a busy-loop on every tick.
