// event vocabulary. Mirrors src/review/auto-tune.ts's own FlagStore-injection precedent (see that file's
// header comment): the pure calibration math lives here, and each host (ORB, AMS) supplies its own
// `SignalStore` implementation wired to whatever it already uses for durable storage (ORB: audit_events over
// D1/Postgres; AMS: the local append-only event ledger). This module does NOT replace either of those --
// see outcomes-wire.ts (ORB) and event-ledger.ts (AMS), which this wraps.
//
// DEFERRED (out of scope here -- foundation only, no behavior change for either consumer until #7983/#7984/
// #7986 actually consume it):
//   • the live SignalStore implementations (the ORB and AMS adapters, wired at the host layer).
//   • any circuit-breaker / alerting action taken FROM a RulePrecisionReport or repeat count -- this module
//     only computes the numbers, exactly like auto-tune.ts's GateEvalReport is computed elsewhere and only
//     READ by the breaker logic.
