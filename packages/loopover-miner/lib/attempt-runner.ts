// Governor chokepoint (#2340, which itself composes kill-switch, dry-run, rate-limit, budget caps, non-
// convergence, self-reputation-throttle, and self-plagiarism -- see chokepoint.ts's own module doc comment for
// the exact precedence ladder) -> on allowed:true, builds the REAL open_pr command via the now-shared
// buildOpenPrSpec (@loopover/engine, moved from root src/mcp/local-write-tools.ts) and executes it.
//
// WORKTREE LIFECYCLE IS NOT THIS MODULE'S JOB: runIterateLoop already takes a plain `workingDirectory` string
// (packages/loopover-engine/src/miner/iterate-loop.ts's own IterateLoopInput), deliberately agnostic about
// where it came from. Allocating one is the caller's job, via the already-built slot allocator
// (worktree-allocator.js, #4297) -- this module composes the create/review/gate/submit sequence #2337 is
// actually about, not worktree allocation policy, which is a separate, already-solved concern.
//
// `deps.runSlopAssessment` stays INJECTED rather than imported here (this module composes the sequence and is
// agnostic about the scorer behind the seam), but it is no longer unwired: slop-assessment.js (#5133) is its
// real production binding -- a direct pass-through to the engine's own buildSlopAssessment -- and attempt-cli.js
// wires that binding in on the production path. The seam was injected-but-unwired when this module was written
// only because the deterministic scorer was not yet portable; #5133 extracted src/signals/slop.ts's PR-side
// scorer into packages/loopover-engine/src/signals/slop.ts (byte-parity-verified against the live gate's own
// copy), closing the gap this header used to document. This function still requires a real implementation be
// injected rather than silently stubbing a result that would either always pass (unsafe) or always fail
// (useless).
//
// `input.governor`'s cross-attempt state (rate-limit buckets, backoff attempts, budget-cap usage) DOES now
// persist across separate process invocations (#5134, governor-state.js), via
// evaluateGovernorChokepointGatePersisted -- callers no longer need to hand-thread honest empty/zero defaults
// on every invocation; `capUsage` is loaded from that same store but its post-attempt save stays the caller's
// job (see governor-chokepoint-persisted.js's own header for why: nothing computes "the next capUsage" from a
// verdict, only the attempt's real outcome does). Self-plagiarism state is now wired here (#5676): the
// prospective submission's real diff `selfPlagiarismCandidate` (fingerprintFromChangedFiles over the handoff
// packet's changed files) and the miner's real `selfPlagiarismRecentSubmissions` (governor-state.js's
// listRecentOwnSubmissions) are computed late -- right before the chokepoint call, after handoff, where the
// changed files first exist -- and passed in, so chokepoint.ts's selfPlagiarismCheck finally runs on real data.
// `input.governor.reputationHistory` remains a caller-supplied optional field, not auto-loaded here yet.
